```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r}
library(reshape2)
data(tips, packages="reshape2")
summary(tips)
str(tips)
```
#1 How many parties did the waiter serve? Store the number in 'numParty' and print
```{r}
summary(tips)
numParty <- c("244 parties")
print(numParty)
```


#2 What are the types of variables in the data frame 'tips'?
```{r}
str(tips)
# total_bill: num
# tip: factor
# sex: factor
# smoker: factor
# day: factor
# time: factor
# size: int
```


#3 Create a vector named 'day' containing the day of visits in 'tips'. The factor levels should be ordered from
Thurs-Sun. Also print the variable.
```{r}
summary(tips$day)
levels(tips$day)
day <- factor(tips$day, levels=c('Thur', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun'))
print(day)
```


#4 Create a dataframe named 'female5' containing the meal paid by a female payer in a party with size greater
#  than or equal to 5. Also print the variable.
```{r}
female5 <- data.frame(tips$sex == 'Female', tips$size >= 5)
female5
print(female5)
```


#5 How does the tipping amount (tip) depend on the overall bill (total_bill)? Describe the relationship in words. Describe at least two types of anomolies in the plot. What do they mean? Use the ggplot2 to make a chart.
Answer: Relationship between the variables tip and total_bill seems to be positive, moderately weak to moderate strength and linear. There seems to be an outliers and as the bill total gets higher- the points seems to spread out like a megaphone. 
The amount that is left for tip depends on the bill total bc in general, most people leave a percentage of the bill total (I always leave 20%) but that is not the case for everyone.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(tips, aes(x=total_bill, y=tip)) + geom_point()
```


#6 Introduce a variable 'tiprate' into the data set, that incorporates the rate of tips. What is the average rate for tips?
Answer: Average rate for tips: 0.16080 or 16.08%
```{r}
tiprate <- tips$tip/tips$total_bill
summary(tiprate)
?tips
```


#7 Make a boxplot of the rate by time. The x-axis should be ordered by lunch and then dinner. Use the ggplot 2 package to make a chart.
```{r}
time <- tips$time
lvlTime <- levels(time)
revTime <- factor(time, levels = rev(lvlTime))
ggplot(tips, aes(x=revTime, y=tiprate)) + geom_boxplot()
```


#8 How does smoking behavior and gender of the person who pays impact the relationship between tip and total bill? Find a visualization that incorporates all four variables. Interpret the result.
Answer: From the looks of the plot, it looks like as the bill total gets higher, a male who doesn't smoke leaves a higher tip than a male who smokes. There doesn't seem to be many females who pay for the bill when the total is higher than $30 also. There seems to be an equal amount of people who smoke and don't smoke.
```{r}
ggplot(tips, aes(x=total_bill, y=tip, color=smoker, shape=sex)) + geom_point() +
  xlab("Total Bill") + ylab("Tip")

```

#9 Use ggplot2 to find a graphical summary of the relationship between day of the week and gender of the person paying the bill. What can you say about this relationship?
Answer: On Thurs&Fri, there seems to be an even amount of people but on Sat&Sun there is a pretty significant change. The number of men doubles, at the least, the amount of women.
```{r}
ggplot(tips, aes(x=sex, fill=day)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~day)
```
